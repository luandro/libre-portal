# Libre Mesh Community Portal

Meant to work with [pirania](https://github.com/libremesh/pirania).

## Usage

You'll need to have NodeJS installed in order to compile the captive portal app and run the scripts.

To copy the *pirania-app* files and install, build and publisht the app just run `npm run install-portal`. By default we're using `thisnode.info` address for acessing the router. In case the publish scripts fail, change the address for acessing the router in the `package.json` and `portal/package.json` scripts.
